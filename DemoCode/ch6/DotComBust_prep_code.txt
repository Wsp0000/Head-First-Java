DotComBust_prep_code
-----------------------------------
DECLARE and instantiate the GameHelper instance variable, named helper.
DECLARE and instantiate an ArrayList to hold the list of DotComs(initially three), named
 dotComsList.
DECLARE an int variable to hold the number of user guesses(so that we can give the user
 a score at the end of the game). Name it numOfGuesses and set it to 0.
//DECLARE a arrayList to keep DotCom names, named dotComNameList// not this version
-----------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECLARE a main() method that create a DotComBust instance, call it dotComBust
 INVOKE setUpGame() method on the DotComBust instance,
 INVOKE startPlayingGame() method on the DotComBust instance

DECLARE a setUpGame() method to create and initialize the DotCom objects with names
 and locations. Display brief instructions to the user
//on the DotComBust instance to create 3 DotCom instance 
 and INVOKE setLocationCells() method on the DotCom
DECLARE a startPlayingGame() method to asks the player to guesses and calls the
 checkUserGuess() method until all the DotCom objects are removed from play.
DECLARE a checkUserGuess() that loops through all remaining DotCom objects and 
 calls each DotCom object's checkYourself() method.
DECLARE a finishGame() method that prints a message about the user's perfomance, based
on how many guesses it took to sink all of the DotCom objects.

	REPEAT with each DotCom objects in the dotComsList array
		CALL the placeDotCom() method on the helper object, to get a randomly-selected
		locations for this DotCom (three cells,vertically or horizontally alignd, on a 7 X 7
		grid)
		SET the location for each DotCom based on the result of the placeDotCom() call.

METHOD: void finishGame()
	//display player score and give comment
	PRINT numOfGuesses
